# D-check
Determine the probability of chance alignment between two small bodies (comets, asteroids or meteoroids).

## Usage
* Generate an NEO orbit distribution using Greenstreet et al. (2012)'s model, available at http://www.sarahgreenstreet.com/neo-model/
* Modify the script and point $gsmodel to the NEOSSat1modelH18extraction.txt generated by Greenstreet's model
* Command: `python2 d-check.py q1 e1 i1 Om1 w1 q2 e2 i2 Om2 w2` (angles in deg)
* Being returned is the probability that one find a better match in the D_SH space.
